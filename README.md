# mern-shopping-list
* This is a simple full stack application built with MERN(MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js). 
* Redux handles state management, Reactstrap, and React Transitions. 
* Add an item to the shopping list by simply clicking the add button at the top of the page. 
* Have you already bought the item or no longer need it. Well, don't worry, simply click the delete button on the side of each item to 
  eliminate it from the list.
